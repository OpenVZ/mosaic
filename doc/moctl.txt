Usage:

   moctl <mosaic> <action> <arguments>

   The <mosaic> argument is the mosaic config file. The moctl
   doesn't generate or change one, it should just exist.

Actions:

* mount: Mounts mosaic or tessera.

  Usage: mount <tessera>|- <path> <flags>

  If tessera name is "-", then the mosaic itself is mounted.

* umount: Umounts stuff mounted with mount action

  Usage: umount <tessera>|- <path>


* new: Creates new empty tessera

  Usage: new fs|disk <tessera> <size>

  If "disk" is given then the plain block device is created,
  if "fs" is given, then the created block device is marked
  with the default filesystem. Some backends do not support
  both types, e.g. btrfs only supports the "fs" type.

  Size accepts KMG suffixes. The <tessera> is the new volume
  name the user wants.

* clone: Clones tessera from some other one

  Usage: clone <tessera_from> <tessera>

  Clone is performed using the COW technology if the backend
  supports this. If it does not, the error is reported back and new
  tessera is not created.

* drop: Drops tessera

  Usage: drop <tessera>

  Removes all the data! The tesserae that were cloned from
  this one are not affected (or error is reported if the backend
  doesn't support such behavior, but we don't have and don't plan
  to have such backends).
